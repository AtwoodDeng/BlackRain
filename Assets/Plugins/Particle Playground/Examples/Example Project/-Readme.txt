This is the showcase project used in the Particle Playground 2.2 release video (http://vimeo.com/polyfied/particleplayground).
On the Scene Manager you'll find the script controlling the scene.
Note that the video is using SE Natural Bloom & Dirty Lens (SENBDL) on the camera and different materials on some scene effects.
