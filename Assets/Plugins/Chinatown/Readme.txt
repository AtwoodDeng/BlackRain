Hi and thank you for purchasing this unity store asset.

If you have any questions please email me: jason_dalton@hotmail.com

The scene requires unity pro to display at it's full potential.

Your player settings must be set to linear color space and deffered rendering if you wish it to match what is shown in the screenshots.

I have noticed that when importing the package that SSAO seems to switch off and can't be turned back on.  I recommend having your image effects installed prior to importing the package.  If that fails, I suggest copying down my settings, deleting the component from the camera and then adding it again.  Be sure SSAO remains in the same position in the stack of post effects as it was originally.

If you end up using this asset in any commercial project, please let me know by email and add me to the credits!

Thanks
Jason
